# Problem Statement
This time I'll solve difficult problems in business. I'm goint to help "Bank of Gardenia" (BoG), a retail bank looking to improve sales from existing customers.

Here, BoG has given a problem statement to optimize the Cross-Sell initiative for the product "Personal Loan". I have the customers information such as age, gender, demographics along with their assets, liabilities and transactions with the bank. My task as a data scientist would be to predict the most likely customers for the product Personal Loan.

# Data provided
BoG has given a partial data (500,000 customers) of their salaried customers, along with their details like age, gender and demographics with their various relationships along all the products. 300,000 customers are in train set and 200,000 customers in test set. I'm going to estimate the probability of customer to opt personal loan (when responder is Y).
